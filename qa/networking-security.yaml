questions:
- question: What is a network?
  answer: A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and information. It can be wired
    or wireless.
- question: What is an IP address?
  answer: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network to facilitate
    communication.
- question: What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
  answer: 'IPv4: 32-bit addressing, supports 4.3 billion addresses.

    IPv6: 128-bit addressing, supports an enormous number of addresses, improving scalability and security.'
- question: What are private and public IP addresses?
  answer: 'Private IPs: Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x).

    Public IPs: Used on the internet and assigned by ISPs.'
- question: What is a subnet mask?
  answer: A subnet mask divides an IP address into network and host portions, determining which part identifies the network
    and which part identifies the device.
- question: What is DHCP, and how does it work?
  answer: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network, reducing
    manual configuration.
- question: What is DNS, and why is it important?
  answer: The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses, making it easier to access
    websites.
- question: What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?
  answer: NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for internet access.

  answer: A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a security buffer between an internal network and the internet, hosting public-facing
    services securely.
- question: What is port forwarding?
  answer: Port forwarding redirects network traffic from one port to another, often used to expose internal services externally.
- question: What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?
  answer: ARP translates IP addresses into MAC addresses to enable communication within a local network.

- question: What is Zero Trust Security?
  answer: Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no entity (inside or outside the network) is trusted by default.
- question: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
  answer: 'Symmetric Encryption: Uses one key for encryption and decryption.

    Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA).'
- question: What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
  answer: A CDN improves website speed and security by distributing content across multiple servers worldwide.

  answer: 'Encryption

    Data integrity

    Authentication'
- question: How does multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhance security?
  answer: MFA adds an extra security layer by requiring multiple verification methods (e.g., password + OTP).

- question: What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?
  answer: A honeypot is a security system designed to detect and study cyberattacks by mimicking real systems.
- question: What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?
  answer: BGP is a routing protocol used for exchanging routing information between networks on the internet.
- question: What is DDoS, and how can it be mitigated?
  answer: A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack overwhelms a system. It can be mitigated using rate limiting, firewalls,
    and cloud-based protection.
- question: What is the CIA Triad in security?
  answer: The CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are fundamental security principles.
- question: What is SSO (Single Sign-On)?
  answer: SSO allows users to log in to multiple applications using a single authentication process.
- question: What is a security token?
  answer: A security token is a physical or digital device used for authentication.
- question: What is an access control list (ACL)?
  answer: An ACL defines rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP, ports, or protocols.
- question: What is a container network security concern?
  answer: Containers share OS kernels, so misconfigurations can expose services to security threats.
- question: What is network segmentation?
  answer: It is dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and performance.
- question: What is the difference between active and passive reconnaissance?
  answer: 'Active reconnaissance: Direct interaction with the target.

    Passive reconnaissance: Collecting data without direct interaction.'
- question: What is mutual TLS (mTLS), and why is it used?
  answer: Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures both client and server authenticate each other before communication, enhancing security
    in microservices and API interactions.
