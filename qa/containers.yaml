questions:
- question: What is Docker, and why is it used?
  answer: 'Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies
    into a single unit called a container.

    Why use Docker?

    ✅ Ensures consistent environments across different machines.

    ✅ Lightweight & faster than virtual machines.

    ✅ Easy scaling of applications in microservices architectures.'
- question: What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine (VM)?
  answer: 'Feature

    Docker

    Virtual Machine

    Isolation

    Uses containers to isolate apps

    Uses hypervisor to run separate OS instances

    Performance

    Faster, lightweight

    Slower, resource-intensive

    Startup Time

    Milliseconds

    Minutes

    Use Case

    Ideal for microservices

    Best for full OS emulation'
- question: What is a Docker image?
  answer: 'A Docker image is a read-only template containing everything needed to run an application, including:

    Source code

    Libraries & dependencies

    Configuration files

    A container is created from a Docker image using the docker run command.'
- question: What is a Docker container?
  answer: 'A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is:

    ✅ Lightweight (shares OS kernel)

    ✅ Isolated (has its own filesystem, network, and process space)

    ✅ Portable (can run on any system with Docker installed)'
- question: How do you create and run a Docker container?
  answer: 'To run a container from an image:

    docker run -d --name myapp nginx

    -d: Run in detached mode (background).

    --name myapp: Name the container myapp.

    nginx: Use the nginx image.'
- question: What is the purpose of the Dockerfile?
  answer: 'A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

    Example Dockerfile:
