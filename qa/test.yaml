- question: What are DevOps best practices?
  answer: |
    Some code example:
    ```yaml
    devops_best_practices:
      - infrastructure_as_code: "Version-control all infrastructure definitions for repeatability and auditability."
      - ci_cd: "Automate build, test, and release pipelines to deliver changes safely and frequently."
      - monitoring_and_logging: "Collect metrics, traces, and logs so issues are
    ```
    Key DevOps best practices include:
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — version-control all infrastructure definitions for repeatability and auditability.

- question: What is the purpose of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
  answer: |
    IaC means defining servers, networks, and other infrastructure in machine-readable files (e.g., Terraform HCL, CloudFormation YAML, Ansible playbooks) rather than clicking through consoles.

    Key benefits:
    - Repeatability: the same code produces identical environments every time, eliminating "works on my machine" drift.
    - Version control: infrastructure changes are reviewed in pull requests and fully auditable via Git history.
    - Faster provisioning: spin up or tear down entire environments in minutes instead of hours.
    - Disaster recovery: re-create a lost environment from code rather than from memory or runbooks.
