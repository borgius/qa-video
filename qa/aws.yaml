questions:
  - question: What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
    answer: AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers on-demand services such as
      compute, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and more. It operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model
      and serves millions of customers worldwide.
  - question: What is the AWS Global Infrastructure?
    answer: |-
      The AWS Global Infrastructure consists of:
      Regions: Geographically isolated areas containing multiple data centers.
      Availability Zones (AZs): Physically separate data centers within a region connected by low-latency links.
      Edge Locations: Endpoints used by CloudFront for content caching and delivery closer to users.
      Local Zones and Wavelength Zones: Extensions that bring AWS services closer to end users for ultra-low latency.
  - question: What is an AWS Region?
    answer: An AWS Region is a geographical area that contains at least two Availability Zones. Each Region is completely
      independent, providing fault isolation. Users choose Regions based on latency, compliance requirements, and
      service availability.
  - question: What is an Availability Zone (AZ) in AWS?
    answer: An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers within a Region, each with redundant power,
      networking, and connectivity. AZs are designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs, enabling high
      availability when applications span multiple AZs.
  - question: What are AWS Edge Locations?
    answer: Edge Locations are data centers used by Amazon CloudFront and other services to cache content closer to end
      users. They reduce latency by serving content from the nearest location rather than the origin server.
  - question: What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?
    answer: >-
      AWS and the customer share security responsibilities:

      AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud — hardware, software, networking, and facilities.

      The customer is responsible for security IN the cloud — data, identity management, OS patching, firewall
      configuration, and encryption.
  - question: What is the AWS Free Tier?
    answer: >-
      The AWS Free Tier provides limited free usage of many AWS services to help new users get started. It includes
      three types:

      Always Free: Services that are always free within limits (e.g., Lambda 1M requests/month).

      12-Month Free: Available for 12 months after sign-up (e.g., 750 hours/month of EC2 t2.micro).

      Trials: Short-term free trials for specific services.
  - question: What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?
    answer: |-
      The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides best practices across six pillars:
      Operational Excellence: Automating operations and responding to events.
      Security: Protecting data and systems.
      Reliability: Recovering from failures and meeting demand.
      Performance Efficiency: Using resources efficiently.
      Cost Optimization: Avoiding unnecessary costs.
      Sustainability: Minimizing environmental impact.
  - question: What is the AWS Management Console?
    answer: The AWS Management Console is a web-based user interface for accessing and managing AWS services. It provides
      dashboards, wizards, and workflows for configuring resources without using the CLI or SDKs.
  - question: What is the AWS CLI?
    answer: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool for managing AWS services from the terminal. It supports
      scripting and automation and is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - question: What are AWS SDKs?
    answer: AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits) are libraries for various programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript,
      Go, etc.) that allow developers to interact programmatically with AWS services from their applications.
  - question: What is AWS CloudShell?
    answer: AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell environment available directly from the AWS Management Console. It comes
      pre-installed with the AWS CLI, SDKs, and common development tools, with 1 GB of persistent storage per Region.
  - question: What is an ARN in AWS?
    answer: "An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a unique identifier for AWS resources. The format is:
      arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id. ARNs are used in IAM policies and API calls to
      specify resources unambiguously."
  - question: What are AWS Tags?
    answer: Tags are key-value pairs attached to AWS resources for organization, cost tracking, automation, and access
      control. For example, you might tag resources with Environment=Production or Team=DevOps.
  - question: What is AWS IAM?
    answer: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that lets you securely control access to AWS resources. It
      allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and policies to define who can access which resources and
      what actions they can perform.
  - question: What is an IAM Policy?
    answer: An IAM Policy is a JSON document that defines permissions. It specifies which actions are allowed or denied on
      which resources. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles. They follow the principle of least
      privilege.
  - question: What is the difference between IAM Users, Groups, and Roles?
    answer: >-
      IAM Users: Individual identities with long-term credentials for people or applications.

      IAM Groups: Collections of users that share the same permissions, simplifying policy management.

      IAM Roles: Temporary identities that can be assumed by users, services, or applications. Roles use temporary
      security credentials and are preferred over long-term access keys.
  - question: What is the IAM root user?
    answer: The root user is the account owner created when an AWS account is first set up. It has unrestricted access to
      all resources. Best practice is to lock away root user credentials, enable MFA, and use IAM users or roles for
      day-to-day tasks.
  - question: What is MFA in AWS?
    answer: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification
      (e.g., a code from a virtual or hardware MFA device) in addition to a password when signing in to the AWS Console
      or performing sensitive API operations.
  - question: What is an IAM Role and when would you use one?
    answer: |-
      An IAM Role is an identity with specific permissions that can be assumed temporarily. Common use cases include:
      Allowing an EC2 instance to access S3 without embedding credentials.
      Cross-account access between AWS accounts.
      Federating external identity providers (SAML, OIDC).
      Granting Lambda functions access to other AWS services.
  - question: What is an IAM Instance Profile?
    answer: An Instance Profile is a container for an IAM Role that is attached to an EC2 instance. It allows the instance
      to assume the role and obtain temporary credentials automatically, eliminating the need to store access keys on
      the instance.
  - question: What is the principle of least privilege in IAM?
    answer: The principle of least privilege means granting only the minimum permissions required for a user, group, or role
      to perform their tasks. This reduces the attack surface and limits the blast radius if credentials are
      compromised.
  - question: What are IAM Policy conditions?
    answer: |-
      Policy conditions allow you to add fine-grained restrictions to IAM policies. Examples include:
      aws:SourceIp — restrict access to specific IP ranges.
      aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent — require MFA.
      aws:RequestedRegion — limit actions to specific Regions.
      StringEquals, DateGreaterThan, IpAddress — condition operators for matching values.
  - question: What is AWS STS?
    answer: AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a service that provides temporary, limited-privilege security credentials.
      It is used by IAM Roles, federation, and cross-account access. The AssumeRole API is the most common STS
      operation.
  - question: What is an IAM Permission Boundary?
    answer: A Permission Boundary is an advanced IAM feature that sets the maximum permissions an IAM entity (user or role)
      can have. Even if broader policies are attached, the effective permissions are the intersection of the identity
      policy and the permission boundary.
  - question: What is AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)?
    answer: AWS IAM Identity Center provides centralized access management for multiple AWS accounts and business
      applications. It supports integration with external identity providers (Active Directory, Okta, etc.) and provides
      a single sign-on portal for users.
  - question: What is an IAM Access Key?
    answer: An IAM Access Key consists of an access key ID and a secret access key used for programmatic access to AWS via
      the CLI, SDKs, or APIs. Best practice is to rotate access keys regularly and prefer IAM Roles over long-term
      access keys.
  - question: What is Amazon EC2?
    answer: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable virtual servers (instances) in the
      cloud. It allows you to launch instances with various operating systems, configure networking and security, and
      scale capacity up or down as needed.
  - question: What are the different EC2 instance types?
    answer: |-
      EC2 instance types are grouped into families based on workload:
      General Purpose (t3, m5): Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
      Compute Optimized (c5, c6g): High-performance processors for batch processing and HPC.
      Memory Optimized (r5, x1): Large in-memory databases and caching.
      Storage Optimized (i3, d2): High sequential read/write access to large datasets.
      Accelerated Computing (p4, g5): GPU-based workloads like ML training and graphics rendering.
  - question: What are EC2 pricing models?
    answer: |-
      AWS offers several EC2 pricing options:
      On-Demand: Pay per second with no commitment, ideal for unpredictable workloads.
      Reserved Instances: 1- or 3-year commitment for up to 72% savings.
      Savings Plans: Flexible pricing based on committed usage ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years.
      Spot Instances: Up to 90% discount by using spare capacity, but instances can be interrupted.
      Dedicated Hosts: Physical servers dedicated to your use for licensing or compliance.
  - question: What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?
    answer: An AMI is a template that contains a software configuration (OS, application server, and applications) used to
      launch EC2 instances. AMIs can be public, shared, or private, and can be created from existing instances for
      reuse.
  - question: What is an EC2 Key Pair?
    answer: A Key Pair consists of a public key (stored by AWS) and a private key (downloaded by the user) used for SSH
      access to Linux instances or decrypting Windows passwords. AWS supports ED25519 and RSA key types.
  - question: What is an EC2 Security Group?
    answer: A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Rules
      are stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed), specified by protocol, port, and source/destination. By
      default, all inbound traffic is denied and all outbound traffic is allowed.
  - question: What is the difference between a Security Group and a Network ACL?
    answer: >-
      Security Groups: Operate at the instance level, are stateful, support only allow rules, and evaluate all rules
      before deciding.

      Network ACLs: Operate at the subnet level, are stateless, support both allow and deny rules, and evaluate rules in
      order by rule number.
  - question: What is EC2 User Data?
    answer: User Data is a script (bash or PowerShell) that runs automatically when an EC2 instance first launches. It is
      used for bootstrapping tasks like installing packages, configuring services, or pulling code from repositories.
  - question: What is an Elastic IP address?
    answer: An Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate and associate with an EC2 instance. It
      remains assigned to your account until released and can be remapped to another instance quickly in case of
      failure.
  - question: What is EC2 Instance Metadata?
    answer: Instance Metadata is data about a running instance accessible from within the instance at
      http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/. It provides information like instance ID, public IP, IAM role
      credentials, and security groups. IMDSv2 (token-based) is recommended for security.
  - question: What is an EC2 Placement Group?
    answer: >-
      Placement Groups control how instances are placed on underlying hardware:

      Cluster: Packs instances close together in a single AZ for low-latency networking.

      Spread: Distributes instances across distinct hardware to reduce correlated failures.

      Partition: Divides instances into logical partitions, each on separate racks, for large distributed systems like
      HDFS or Cassandra.
  - question: What are EC2 Spot Instances?
    answer: Spot Instances let you use spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand. AWS can reclaim them
      with a 2-minute warning when capacity is needed. They are ideal for fault-tolerant workloads like batch
      processing, CI/CD, and data analysis.
  - question: What is an EC2 Auto Scaling Group?
    answer: An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. You define
      minimum, maximum, and desired capacity, along with scaling policies triggered by CloudWatch metrics like CPU
      utilization or request count.
  - question: What is an EC2 Launch Template?
    answer: A Launch Template specifies instance configuration details such as AMI ID, instance type, key pair, security
      groups, and user data. It supports versioning and is used by Auto Scaling Groups and the RunInstances API. Launch
      Templates have replaced Launch Configurations.
  - question: What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?
    answer: Stopping an instance shuts it down but preserves the root EBS volume and instance metadata. You can restart it
      later. Terminating an instance permanently deletes it and, by default, deletes the root EBS volume. Stopped
      instances do not incur compute charges but EBS storage charges still apply.
  - question: What is EC2 Hibernation?
    answer: EC2 Hibernation saves the contents of instance RAM to the root EBS volume before stopping. When the instance
      starts again, it restores RAM contents and resumes processes. This provides faster startup compared to a cold
      boot. The root volume must be encrypted and large enough to hold the RAM contents.
  - question: What is a Dedicated Host vs a Dedicated Instance?
    answer: >-
      Dedicated Host: A physical server fully dedicated to your use, giving visibility into sockets, cores, and host ID.
      Useful for bring-your-own-license (BYOL) scenarios.

      Dedicated Instance: Runs on hardware dedicated to your account but you do not control placement or have visibility
      into the physical host.
  - question: What is Amazon EBS?
    answer: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. EBS volumes
      are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone and can be attached to running instances. They persist
      independently from the life of an instance.
  - question: What are the different EBS volume types?
    answer: |-
      AWS offers several EBS volume types:
      gp3/gp2 (General Purpose SSD): Balanced price and performance for most workloads.
      io2/io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD): High-performance for latency-sensitive, I/O-intensive workloads like databases.
      st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD): Low-cost for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.
      sc1 (Cold HDD): Lowest cost for infrequently accessed data.
  - question: What is an EBS Snapshot?
    answer: An EBS Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS volume stored in S3. Snapshots are incremental — only
      changed blocks are stored. They can be used to create new volumes, copy volumes across Regions, or share volumes
      with other accounts.
  - question: What is EBS Encryption?
    answer: EBS Encryption encrypts data at rest, data in transit between the instance and the volume, and all snapshots. It
      uses AWS KMS keys and has minimal impact on performance. Encryption can be enabled by default at the account level
      for all new volumes.
  - question: What is EBS Multi-Attach?
    answer: EBS Multi-Attach allows a single io2 volume to be attached to up to 16 Nitro-based EC2 instances in the same
      Availability Zone simultaneously. It is useful for clustered applications that manage concurrent write operations.
  - question: How do you increase the size of an EBS volume?
    answer: "You can modify an EBS volume using the Elastic Volumes feature without detaching it. Steps include: using the
      ModifyVolume API or Console to increase size, then extending the filesystem on the instance using resize2fs (ext4)
      or xfs_growfs (XFS). Volume modifications may take time to complete."
  - question: What is Amazon S3?
    answer: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable object storage service that provides 99.999999999% (11 nines)
      durability. It stores data as objects in buckets and is used for backups, static website hosting, data lakes,
      application assets, and more.
  - question: What are S3 storage classes?
    answer: |-
      S3 offers multiple storage classes:
      S3 Standard: Frequently accessed data with low latency.
      S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between tiers based on access patterns.
      S3 Standard-IA: Infrequently accessed data with rapid access when needed.
      S3 One Zone-IA: Infrequently accessed data stored in a single AZ.
      S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Archive with millisecond retrieval.
      S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: Archive with retrieval in minutes to hours.
      S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost for long-term archive with 12-hour retrieval.
  - question: What is an S3 Bucket Policy?
    answer: An S3 Bucket Policy is a JSON-based resource policy attached directly to a bucket. It defines who can access the
      bucket and what actions they can perform. Bucket policies support cross-account access and are commonly used to
      grant public read access for static website hosting.
  - question: What is S3 Versioning?
    answer: S3 Versioning keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. When enabled, every overwrite or delete
      creates a new version rather than replacing the object. This protects against accidental deletion and allows you
      to restore previous versions.
  - question: What is S3 Lifecycle Management?
    answer: S3 Lifecycle policies automate transitioning objects between storage classes or deleting them after a defined
      period. For example, you can move objects to S3 Glacier after 90 days and delete them after 365 days, optimizing
      storage costs.
  - question: What is S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?
    answer: CRR automatically replicates objects from a source bucket in one Region to a destination bucket in a different
      Region. It requires versioning to be enabled on both buckets and is used for compliance, latency reduction, and
      disaster recovery.
  - question: What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
    answer: S3 Transfer Acceleration speeds up uploads to S3 by routing data through CloudFront Edge Locations using
      optimized network paths. It is beneficial for long-distance transfers and uses a distinct endpoint
      (bucketname.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com).
  - question: What is an S3 Pre-signed URL?
    answer: A Pre-signed URL grants temporary access to a private S3 object without requiring AWS credentials. The URL is
      generated with a specific expiration time and can be used for secure, time-limited downloads or uploads.
  - question: What is S3 Object Lock?
    answer: >-
      S3 Object Lock prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a specified period. It supports two
      retention modes:

      Governance Mode: Users with special permissions can override the lock.

      Compliance Mode: No one, including the root user, can delete the object until the retention period expires.
  - question: What is S3 Event Notification?
    answer: S3 Event Notifications trigger actions when specific events occur in a bucket, such as object creation or
      deletion. Notifications can be sent to Lambda functions, SQS queues, SNS topics, or EventBridge for event-driven
      architectures.
  - question: What is S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select?
    answer: S3 Select allows you to retrieve a subset of data from an object using SQL expressions, reducing the amount of
      data transferred. Glacier Select does the same for archived data. Both support CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats.
  - question: How does S3 ensure data consistency?
    answer: S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for all operations. After a successful write (PUT) or delete,
      any subsequent read request immediately returns the latest version of the object. This applies to all S3 storage
      classes.
  - question: What is S3 Multipart Upload?
    answer: Multipart Upload allows you to upload large objects in parts (up to 10,000 parts). Each part is uploaded
      independently and can be retried on failure. It is recommended for objects larger than 100 MB and is required for
      objects larger than 5 GB.
  - question: What is Amazon VPC?
    answer: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you create a logically isolated network within AWS where you can launch
      resources in a virtual network you define. You control IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
  - question: What is a Subnet in AWS VPC?
    answer: >-
      A Subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC, confined to a single Availability Zone. Subnets are classified
      as:

      Public Subnet: Has a route to an Internet Gateway, allowing internet access.

      Private Subnet: No direct route to the internet, used for backend resources like databases.
  - question: What is an Internet Gateway?
    answer: An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scaled, redundant VPC component that allows communication between
      instances in a VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 and performs network address translation for
      instances with public IPs.
  - question: What is a NAT Gateway?
    answer: A NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to access the internet for updates and patches while
      preventing inbound connections from the internet. It is managed by AWS, supports up to 45 Gbps bandwidth, and is
      deployed in a public subnet.
  - question: What is a Route Table in VPC?
    answer: A Route Table contains a set of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet
      must be associated with a route table. Routes specify a destination CIDR block and a target (IGW, NAT Gateway, VPC
      Peering, etc.).
  - question: What is VPC Peering?
    answer: VPC Peering creates a networking connection between two VPCs, allowing instances in either VPC to communicate
      using private IP addresses. Peering can be between VPCs in the same account, different accounts, or different
      Regions. It is non-transitive.
  - question: What is AWS Transit Gateway?
    answer: AWS Transit Gateway acts as a central hub that connects multiple VPCs, VPN connections, and Direct Connect
      gateways. It simplifies network topology by replacing complex VPC peering meshes and supports transitive routing
      between connected networks.
  - question: What is a VPC Endpoint?
    answer: >-
      A VPC Endpoint allows private connectivity to AWS services without traversing the internet:

      Gateway Endpoint: For S3 and DynamoDB, added to route tables.

      Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink): Creates an ENI in your subnet for services like SQS, KMS, and third-party
      services.
  - question: What is AWS PrivateLink?
    answer: AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises networks without
      exposing traffic to the public internet. It uses Interface VPC Endpoints and is the recommended way to access
      services privately.
  - question: What are VPC Flow Logs?
    answer: VPC Flow Logs capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC. They can be
      published to CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose and are used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and
      security analysis.
  - question: What is a CIDR block in VPC?
    answer: A CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) block defines the IP address range for a VPC or subnet. For example,
      10.0.0.0/16 provides 65,536 IP addresses. VPCs support IPv4 CIDR blocks from /16 to /28 and can have secondary
      CIDR blocks added.
  - question: What is a Network ACL (NACL)?
    answer: A Network ACL is a stateless firewall at the subnet level that controls inbound and outbound traffic with
      numbered rules. Rules are evaluated in order, and both allow and deny rules are supported. The default NACL allows
      all traffic.
  - question: What is Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)?
    answer: ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers,
      IPs, Lambda functions) in one or more Availability Zones. It improves fault tolerance and provides high
      availability for applications.
  - question: What are the types of AWS Load Balancers?
    answer: >-
      AWS provides three types of load balancers:

      Application Load Balancer (ALB): Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, supports path-based and host-based routing, WebSockets, and
      gRPC.

      Network Load Balancer (NLB): Layer 4, TCP/UDP/TLS, handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency,
      supports static IPs.

      Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): Layer 3, deploys and scales third-party virtual appliances like firewalls and
      intrusion detection systems.
  - question: What is an ALB Target Group?
    answer: A Target Group routes requests to registered targets (instances, IPs, or Lambda functions) based on health
      checks and routing rules. ALBs use Target Groups to distribute traffic, and a single ALB can route to multiple
      Target Groups based on URL path or hostname.
  - question: What is sticky sessions (session affinity) in ELB?
    answer: Sticky sessions bind a user's session to a specific target, ensuring all requests from the same client go to the
      same instance. ALB supports application-based cookies and duration-based cookies. This is useful for stateful
      applications but can cause uneven load distribution.
  - question: What is connection draining (deregistration delay)?
    answer: Connection draining ensures that in-flight requests are completed before an instance is deregistered from the
      load balancer. The default deregistration delay is 300 seconds. During this period, no new requests are sent to
      the deregistering instance.
  - question: How does ALB path-based routing work?
    answer: |-
      ALB path-based routing directs requests to different Target Groups based on the URL path. For example:
      /api/* routes to API server Target Group.
      /images/* routes to image server Target Group.
      Default route (/*) goes to the main web server Target Group.
      This enables microservices architecture behind a single load balancer.
  - question: What is Amazon Route 53?
    answer: Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It provides domain
      registration, DNS routing, and health checking. The name refers to port 53, the standard DNS port.
  - question: What are the Route 53 routing policies?
    answer: |-
      Route 53 supports several routing policies:
      Simple: Returns a single resource for a domain.
      Weighted: Distributes traffic based on assigned weights.
      Latency-based: Routes to the Region with lowest latency.
      Failover: Routes to a standby resource when the primary is unhealthy.
      Geolocation: Routes based on the geographic location of the user.
      Geoproximity: Routes based on geographic location with bias shifting.
      Multi-value Answer: Returns multiple healthy resources (up to 8).
  - question: What are Route 53 Health Checks?
    answer: Route 53 Health Checks monitor the health of endpoints by sending requests at regular intervals. If an endpoint
      fails health checks, Route 53 stops routing traffic to it. Health checks can monitor endpoints, CloudWatch alarms,
      or other health checks (calculated health checks).
  - question: What is a Route 53 Hosted Zone?
    answer: |-
      A Hosted Zone is a container for DNS records for a domain:
      Public Hosted Zone: Resolves queries from the internet for a public domain.
      Private Hosted Zone: Resolves queries from within associated VPCs for private domain names.
  - question: What is the difference between an Alias record and a CNAME record in Route 53?
    answer: A CNAME maps one domain name to another but cannot be used at the zone apex (e.g., example.com). An Alias record
      is AWS-specific, can be used at the zone apex, is free of charge for queries, and can point to AWS resources like
      ALBs, CloudFront, and S3 buckets. Alias records are generally preferred.
  - question: What is Amazon CloudFront?
    answer: Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches and delivers content from Edge Locations
      worldwide. It accelerates delivery of static and dynamic web content, APIs, and video streaming with low latency
      and high transfer speeds.
  - question: What is a CloudFront Origin?
    answer: A CloudFront Origin is the source of the content that CloudFront distributes. Origins can be S3 buckets, ALBs,
      EC2 instances, or any HTTP server. CloudFront retrieves content from the origin when it is not cached at an Edge
      Location.
  - question: What is a CloudFront Distribution?
    answer: |-
      A CloudFront Distribution is the configuration for how content is delivered. There are two types:
      Web Distribution: For websites, APIs, and HTTP/HTTPS content.
      RTMP Distribution (deprecated): For media streaming.
      Distributions specify origins, cache behaviors, SSL certificates, and geographic restrictions.
  - question: What is Origin Access Control (OAC) in CloudFront?
    answer: Origin Access Control restricts direct access to an S3 bucket, ensuring users can only access content through
      CloudFront. OAC replaces the older Origin Access Identity (OAI) and supports S3 server-side encryption with KMS,
      dynamic requests, and S3 in all Regions.
  - question: What are CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge?

      across 3 AZs with 6 copies.
  - question: What is an RDS Multi-AZ deployment?
    answer: Multi-AZ deployment creates a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. It provides high
      availability and automatic failover (typically 60-120 seconds). The standby is not available for read queries — it
      is purely for failover.
  - question: What are RDS Read Replicas?
    answer: Read Replicas are asynchronous copies of the primary database used to offload read traffic. They can be created
      within the same Region, across Regions, or promoted to standalone databases. Up to 15 read replicas are supported
      for Aurora.
  - question: What is RDS automated backup?
    answer: RDS automated backups create daily snapshots and capture transaction logs. They enable point-in-time recovery to
      any second within the retention period (1-35 days). Backups are stored in S3 and have zero impact on database
      performance for Multi-AZ deployments.
  - question: What is an RDS DB Subnet Group?
    answer: A DB Subnet Group is a collection of subnets (typically private) across multiple Availability Zones that you
      designate for your RDS instances. It ensures the database can be deployed in a Multi-AZ configuration within your
      VPC.
  - question: What is Amazon RDS Proxy?
    answer: RDS Proxy is a fully managed database proxy that pools and shares database connections. It improves application
      scalability, reduces database failover time by up to 66%, and enforces IAM authentication. It is especially useful
      for Lambda functions that create many short-lived connections.
  - question: What is the difference between RDS Multi-AZ and Read Replicas?
    answer: >-
      Multi-AZ: Synchronous replication, automatic failover, same Region only, standby not readable. Purpose is high
      availability.

      Read Replicas: Asynchronous replication, no automatic failover, can be cross-Region, readable. Purpose is read
      scalability and disaster recovery.

      document data models.
  - question: What are DynamoDB partition keys and sort keys?
    answer: >-
      The partition key (hash key) determines which partition stores the data. The sort key (range key) is optional and
      enables range queries within a partition. Together they form the primary key:

      Simple primary key: Partition key only.

      Composite primary key: Partition key + sort key.
  - question: What is DynamoDB capacity mode?
    answer: >-
      DynamoDB offers two capacity modes:

      Provisioned: You specify read/write capacity units (RCUs/WCUs) with optional auto-scaling. More cost-effective for
      predictable workloads.

      On-Demand: Automatically scales to handle any traffic level. No capacity planning needed. Better for unpredictable
      or spiky workloads.
  - question: What is a DynamoDB Global Secondary Index (GSI)?
    answer: A GSI is an index with a partition key and optional sort key different from the primary key. It allows querying
      on non-key attributes. GSIs have their own provisioned throughput and contain a projection of the base table's
      attributes.
  - question: What is DynamoDB Streams?
    answer: DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in a table.
      Streams can trigger Lambda functions for event-driven processing, enabling use cases like cross-region
      replication, analytics, and aggregation.
  - question: What is DynamoDB Global Tables?

      (notifications), CloudWatch Events/EventBridge (scheduled tasks), Kinesis (stream processing), Cognito
      (authentication events), and ALB (HTTP requests).
  - question: What are Lambda Layers?
    answer: Lambda Layers allow you to package libraries, custom runtimes, and other dependencies separately from your
      function code. Layers can be shared across multiple functions and accounts. A function can use up to 5 layers, and
      the total unzipped size must be under 250 MB.
  - question: What is Lambda concurrency?
    answer: |-
      Lambda concurrency is the number of function instances serving requests simultaneously:
      Unreserved Concurrency: Shared pool across all functions (default account limit is 1,000).
      Reserved Concurrency: Guarantees a set number of concurrent executions for a function.
      Provisioned Concurrency: Pre-initializes instances to avoid cold starts, ensuring consistent latency.
  - question: What is a Lambda cold start?
    answer: A cold start occurs when Lambda creates a new execution environment for a function invocation. It includes
      downloading code, starting the runtime, and running initialization code. Cold starts add latency (typically 100ms
      to several seconds) and can be mitigated with Provisioned Concurrency.
  - question: What are Lambda environment variables?
    answer: Environment variables are key-value pairs configured for a Lambda function that are accessible in code at

      Standard Queue: Nearly unlimited throughput, at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering. Messages may be
      delivered more than once or out of order.

      FIFO Queue: Exactly-once processing, strict ordering, up to 300 messages/second (3,000 with batching). Messages
      are delivered in the exact order they are sent.
  - question: What is SQS Visibility Timeout?
    answer: Visibility Timeout is the period during which a message is hidden from other consumers after being read. If the
      consumer does not delete the message within this period, it becomes visible again for reprocessing. Default is 30
      seconds, maximum is 12 hours.
  - question: What is an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)?
    answer: A Dead Letter Queue receives messages that could not be processed successfully after a specified number of
      attempts (maxReceiveCount). DLQs help isolate and debug problematic messages without losing them.
  - question: What is SQS Long Polling?
    answer: Long Polling waits for messages to arrive before returning a response, reducing empty responses and API costs.
      It is configured by setting the WaitTimeSeconds parameter (1-20 seconds). Long Polling is preferred over Short
      Polling for most use cases.
  - question: What is the maximum message size in SQS?

      notifications.
  - question: What is the difference between SNS and SQS?
    answer: SNS is a push-based pub/sub service that sends messages to multiple subscribers simultaneously (fan-out). SQS is
      a pull-based queue where consumers poll for messages. They are often used together — SNS fans out messages to
      multiple SQS queues for parallel processing.
  - question: What is an SNS FIFO Topic?
    answer: SNS FIFO Topics provide strict message ordering and exactly-once delivery. They can only deliver to SQS FIFO
      queues. FIFO Topics support message deduplication and ordering by message group ID, ensuring messages are
      processed in the correct sequence.
  - question: What is SNS Message Filtering?
    answer: SNS Message Filtering allows subscribers to receive only a subset of messages published to a topic. Filter
      policies are JSON documents attached to subscriptions that match message attributes. This eliminates the need for
      subscribers to filter messages themselves.
